### bind: address already in use

the server can leave open connections after termination

```
$ netstat -nap 2>/dev/null | grep -w 1080 
tcp6       0      0 ::1:45616               ::1:1080                TIME_WAIT   -           
```

"fixed" by waiting for the kernel to close the connections

man netstat

```
   -p, --program
       Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.  A hyphen is shown if the socket belongs to the kernel (e.g. a kernel service,
       or the process has exited but the socket hasn't finished closing yet).
```
